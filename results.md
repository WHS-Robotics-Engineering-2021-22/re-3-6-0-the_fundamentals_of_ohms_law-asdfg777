total current: 13.28 mA
total resistance: 376.51 
led resistance: 126.51 
I was off with my calculation for the led's resistance according to voltage drop
CHanging the led to germanium nearly halved the voltage drop and lowered resistance.
Random number generated: 6.28
Acheived with Led 1N34 and 640 ohm resistor
